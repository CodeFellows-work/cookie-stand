      <h2>How we began...</h2> 
      <p>It all started with a boy named One-eyed Jack. The reason for this intriguing nick-name came from a fascinating story. One-eyed Jack, loved to fish and sail out ot the seas every morning. This real-life fantasy came to a destructive halt, when he encountered the mystical being, "The Salmon That Spoke". The salmon presented itself through a light mist, and in a state where the seas were calm enough to look like glass. One-eyed Jack, fascinated with the presence of the salmon - only had one thing running through his mind. "I need to catch this salmon". On-eyed Jack threw his fishing line out into the liquid glass, as the weight of the fishing sinker shattered the calm seas upon impact. The salmon, angered by Jack's greed, flew up to the surface, and spoke. Jack was confused. appalled. "Salmon is not supposed to speak" Jack uttered. The salmon evened more angered yelled out, "you fool" and threw a cookie into his left eye. Jack is panicking. As the salmon dove back into the calm seas - suddenly, the dark clouds which acted like a blackhole for light, surrounded the ocean. Rain, started to fall in forms of spears. Thunder, was as if Zeuz himself was angered - screamed. Jack was disoriented, scared, pain. As the seas that were once liquid glass, turned into Hell's decendants reaching out and slapping the boat, Jack was thrown off of the boat... </p>
